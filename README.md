A Facial Detection Program in Python that I created to learn about the OpenCV Library

Required Libraries:
- OpenCV (needs to be installed)
- NumPy (needs to by installed)
- OS (included with python)
- Sys (included with python) 

Library Installation with pip package manager:
- 'pip install numpy' to install NumPy
- 'pip install opencv-python' to install OpenCV

Commands:
- 'python faceDetect.py' to see usage cases
- 'python faceDetect.py [path/to/file]' to pass an image into the program
- 'python faceDetect.py camera' to pass camera stream into the program
